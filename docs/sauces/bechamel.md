# Roux (White Sauce)

## Ingredients

* 2 tbl spoons butter
* 4 tbl spoons plain flour
* ~2 cups milk

## Method

1. In a small, heavy based saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over the
lowest heat possible.

1. Blend the flour into the melted butter; you're looking for the mixture to
be so thick that as the butter begins to boil there's enough flour to make it
a thick paste. Periodically stir with a whisk for about 4-5 minutes. Don't
walk away from the stove as you need to keep the mixture mixing to ensure the
flour does not burn.

1. When the flour begins to pick up a very light brown colour and as the
mixture becomes fluffy, pour in a splash of the first cup of milk and ensure
it's fully mixed before adding in more.

1. Raise the heat and as the sauce thickens add in small amounts of more milk.
given that sauces thicken as they cool you want it to be a little runny.
Periodically remove the whisk and note the thickness of the sauce dripping back
in to the pot.

## Extra credit

If making a sauce for serving with corned beef add in 1-2 tea spoons of pepper
and a tea spoon of salt. Given that the sauce is very creamy an above average
amount of pepper may be required. As always add a little, mix, wait and sample.
