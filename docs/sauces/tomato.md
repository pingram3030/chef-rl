# Tomato Soup/Sauce

## Ingredients

* Tomatoes
* Salt
* Pepper

## Method

1. Pre-heat oven to 200c.

1. Cut tomatoes in half, place them cut side up in an oven safe dish and season
with salt and pepper and drizzle olive oil over top. With the cut side being
exposed the s&p can be absorbed as the tomatoes cook.

1. Bake in the oven until parts of some tomatoes are starting to brown/lightly
burn.

1. Ask the question "Will it blend", then answer it.

1. Pour mixture through a sieve to filter out seeds and larger parts of skin.

## Extra-credit

* Tomatoes are highly acidic, so consider adding unprocessed sugar to take the
edge off

* Not much salt is needed to complement and balance the tartness. If this is
the base for another sauce it is advised to wait until all ingredients are
mixed before adding additional salt.
