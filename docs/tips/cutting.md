# Cutting Tips

* Don't cut off your finger tips. Curl your fingers over when holding food
you're cutting and let the face of the blade rest on your knuckles. As you
should never raise the edge more than a couple of millimeters above the
cutting surface there is a reduced risk of doing yourself a mischief.

* If slicing carrots, cut the big end first. As you cut down the carrot it
will be easier to end on the smallest part than trying to cut a balancing
coin. 

* Use a wooden chopping block. Wood has anti-bacterial properties and is
better for a sharp blade to bed in to.

* Wipe a blade from its spine to its cutting edge; wipe away. Never wipe it the
other way around and never along the edge..

* Keep your blades keen! A sharp blade:

    * Does not need to be forced, so you don't have to apply much pressure
    which may cause the food you are holding to roll or slip.

    * More readily beds itself in what you are cutting, so there is less
    a chance of it slipping side to side.

    * Should be kept keen with a [knife steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honing_steel).
    Any form of grinding leaves the cutting edge serrated which is more
    dangerous to use. The steel will knock off the rough edges and leave the
    cutting edge smooth and much sharper. 

    * Causes less damage if you cut yourself; meaning tearing of your flesh
    versus slicing it. This means that scarring is reduced and the chance
    of infection decreased because it's easier to clean the wound; there are
    fewer tears and places for bacteria to get in to. Also, because a sharp
    blade needs to be used with less force it is less likely that you will be
    pushing with much pressure.

    * Reduces the chance of blade damage as you effectively grind out any
    nicks or dents in the edge reducing places for a stress fracture to form
    which increases the chance of developing more issues.

    * Levels up your ability to be 1337 and use a steel.

    * Should only be ground when a lick of the steel has to be done at
    too great an angle, when the steel can't make the edge keen or when
    there is a chip or other damage on the cutting edge.

* Invest in a knife made from good quality steel. It will require less effort
to keep sharp and will hold its edge longer too!

* Give your blade a lick of a steel at least every second time you use it for
cutting lots of things.
