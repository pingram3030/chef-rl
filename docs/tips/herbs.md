# Working with herbs and spices

* Adding spices is far easier than removing them; add them sparingly.

* Use spoons for measuring out herbs and spices, pinches are too inconsistent.

* Once you've made your meal if you're trying to figure out which spices are
too strong or too weak, sniff each source herb individually while some of the
food is in your mouth; it will help you train your nose.
