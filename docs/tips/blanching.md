# Blanching

Blanching is the technique of using boiling water to aid the removal of skin
from foods such as tomatoes.

There is no need what so ever to buy and/or use canned tomatoes as they can be
made easily in the comfort and safety of your own home.

## Tomatoes

1. Wash and de-stem tomatoes.

1. Put enough tomatoes in a pot that they move about loosely before adding
water; to avoid the Archimedes' principle. Bring the water to the boil and
maintain at a high.

1. While the water is coming up to temperature, cut a cross in the bottom of
the tomato, it will make peeling them later easier. Tip: Use a steak, or other
serated, knife to easily cut through the skin.

1. Carefully lower the tomatoes in to the boiling water with a sieved ladel, or
equivalent.

1. After a minute or so lift out the tomatoes and place them in to a bowl
filled with cold water. If you are doing a lot of tomatoes you will need to
refill the water as it will get rather warm.

1. Once all tomatoes are blanched, peel off the skin. You may wish to reuse the
knife you used to cut the cross, but as always be careful as peeled tomatoes
are quite slippery.
