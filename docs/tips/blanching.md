# Blanching

Blanching is the technique of using boiling water to aid the removal of skin
from foods such as tomatoes.

There is no need what so ever to buy and/or use canned tomatoes as both can be
made easily in the comfort and safety of your own home.

## Tomatoes

1. Wash and de-stem tomatoes.

1. Put enough tomatoes in a pot that they move about loosely before adding
water to avoid the Archimedes' principle. Bring the water to the boil and
maintain at a high.

1. While the water is coming up to temperature, cut a cross in the bottom of
the tomato, it will make peeling them later easier.

1. Carefully lower the tomatoes in to the boiling water with a sieved ladel, or
equivalent.

1. After a minute or so lift out the tomatoes and place them in to a bowl
filled with cold water. If you are doing a lot of tomatoes you will need to
refill the water as it will get rather warm.

1. Once all tomatoes are blanched, peel off the skin with a steak knife; steak
knives are a safe option when dealing with wet slippery tomatoes, so still be
careful.
