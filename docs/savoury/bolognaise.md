# Bolognaise

A proper bolognaise sauce takes several hours from start to completion, but the
time invested is worth it. Ingredients other than those listed below, like
carrot, or other vegetables, should not find their way in to this sauce; else
it ceases to be a proper bolognaise..

## Ingredients

* 1 Bottle of red, preferably Shiraz/Syrah, Cabernet's can be too fuity/plummy.
* 2kg Tomatoes, [blanched](../tips/blanching) , peeled and [diced](../tips/cutting).
* 500g Beef mince
* 500g Pork mince
* 500g Lamb mince (optional, but all other ingredients must be increased by 50%)
* 250g Mushrooms, sliced (either white or brown)
* 2 Onions, diced
* 3 Cloves garlic, crushed
* 1 Heaped tablespoon plain flower
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* 1 Teaspoon pepper
* 2 Teaspoons basil
* 1 Teaspoon oregano
* 1 Teaspoon salt
* A healthy pinch of sugar
* A dash of cinnamon (if you can taste it, you've used too much)

You will need a volumous pot to cook all of this in and either Parmisan or
Romano cheese for serving.

## Method

Ensure that all ingredients are prepared and close at hand. Once cooking
begins, there's little time for anything else until you reach the simmer stage.

1. Heat the oil until it begins to ripple or smoke.

1. Add the oinions and stir thoroughly. Stir frequently to ensure they don't
burn, you want them to brown and turn a little translucent.

1. When the onions are becoming translucent add in the mushrooms.

1. Once the smell of the mushrooms cooking has emanated, add in the mince; stir
frequently until the meat has turned from red/pink.

1. Add in all spices, flour and garlic. Mix loosely.

1. Immediatly add the tomatoes and a generously healthy glass of wine; the rest
of the wine can be used for what ever purpose you see fit from here on out.

1. Bring to the boil then return it to a rolling simmer until nearly all of the
left over water has evapourated; this can take a couple of hours. Be sure to
periodically stir to stop the mixture at the base of the pot from burning.

## Notes

* You can always add spices to a dish, but never take them out..

* If the sauce is acidic, add sugar. If the sauce is sweet, add pepper. If the
sauce is bland, add salt.

* As there is a lot of mass to the sauce, it can be difficult to stir. A good
technique to avoid spillages is to pull the sauce from the outside of the
saucepan to the middle; slightly scooping the mixture up as you go. This stops
the sauce *slopping* against the sides and splashing.

* The tomatoes add quite a lot of water to the sauce, so leave uncovered for
the water to evapourate; stir every 15ish minutes. Every time you go back to
the sauce, take note of how much fluid rests on top of the sauce mass. Turn the
heat off once there is only a small amount of fuid left; leave to cool.

* By now several hours have passed and the smell of onion and garlic should be
ubiquitous throughout your house; if this is the case, you have succeeded. The
sauce should now be a browny colour; any bolognaise that is red uses artificial
colouring, which is bad, m'kay. I advocate for searching around for someone who
can sell you fresh, not dried, pasta as it's more than worth the effort.

* Scoop out any remaining fluid prior to serving; don't mix it in as it will end
up pooling uselessly in the bottom of what ever recepticle you serve it in.
