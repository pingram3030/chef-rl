# Barbeque Chicken

## Ingredients

* 8 thigh fillets
* Juice from 1 lemon
* 1 heaped teaspoon of oregano
* 1 large clove of garlic, crushed
* 1/2 teaspoon of salt
* 1/2 teaspoon of pepper
* Healthy amount of olive oil

## Method

1. Combine all ingredients and leave to marinate overnight.

1. Cook the chicken on your barbeque's grill over a medium-low heat to ensure
the meat cooks all the way through; cooking time will vary depending on
thickness.

## Notes

* Until the meat in contact with the grill has fully seered it will stick to
the grill; just wait until you need to flip them before moving them around.

* Because you need to ensure the core of the chicken gets up to at least 75
degrees celcius (348 Kelvin) you can either use a meat thermometer (preferred),
or stick a skewer in to the meat and observe the juices that flow out. If the
juices are clear, then it's cooked; else you may make yourself quite sick.

* Cooked chicken can be pink, but see the note above.

* Rebasting with any left over marinating juices when you flip the pieces is
advised.
