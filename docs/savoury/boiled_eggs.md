# Boiled Eggs

## Ingredients

* Eggs
* Water
* Salt or vinegar

## Method

For extra runny yolk you must start with cold, refrigerated eggs.

1. Place the eggs gently in an empty pot.

1. Fill the pot with enough cold tap water to cover the eggs completely. By
adding water to the eggs you avoid practically demonstrating Archimedes'
principle. Remove the eggs from the water with a sieved ladel, or equivalent.

1. Add enough salt to make the water taste salty. Adding salt increases the
boiling point of water with enables the eggs to cook faster on the outside
before the core rises enough to start cooking the yolk.

1. Put on a lid and boil the water with a high heat.

1. Now you have boiling water you can conduct an experiment:

    1. Mark each of the eggs with a felt tipped pen; only small marks are
    required.

    1. Set a reliable time source going and add the eggs back to the water
    one at a time at 30 second intervals.

    1. After a predetermined period of time turn off the heat, carefully lift
    and move the pot to your sink and pour in cold water until the water
    becomes cool to the touch. **Note: you should wait a few seconds after
    flushing with cold water as the 100c of heat takes a short time to
    disipate..**

    1. Sample the eggs and decide on a favourite.
