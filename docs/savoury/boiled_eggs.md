# Boiled Eggs

## Ingredients

* Eggs
* Water
* Salt or vinegar

## Method

* You must start with cold, refrigerated eggs.

1. Place the eggs gently in an empty pot. If you accidentally crack an egg,
adding salt or vinegar to the water may help the proteins in the egg white
coagulate faster to plug the cracks in the shell.

1. Fill the pot with enough cold tap water to cover the eggs completely, with
about 3 cm of water over them. Use cold water to help keep the eggs from
overcooking, even though it increases cooking times.

1. Add enough salt to make the water taste salty. This can make the eggs easier
to peel because, as mentioned earlier, the proteins coagulate and firm up,
making the white easier to separate from the shell. Also, eggs that are less
fresh are easier to peel because their higher pH strengthens the membrane.
(This can be simulated by making the cooking water more alkaline with a half
teaspoon of baking soda per quart of water.) Be careful not to add too much!

1. Put on a lid and bring the water to the point of boiling, over high heat.

1. As soon as the water boils, turn off the heat, but keep the pot on the warm
stove. Do not remove the lid. Leave the eggs in the hot water for fifteen
minutes for hard boiled. It is important you do not start the timer until the
water starts boiling, and you turn off the heat. Too much time will make the
eggs discolored and smelly, while too little time will cause them to be runny.

1. Stop the cooking process. Chill the eggs by placing them under cold running
water or in a bowl of ice water. Let them sit for a few minutes until the eggs
are completely cool.

1. Peel the eggs when they are cool enough to handle. It's easier to peel them
under cold running water. Some people say that really fresh eggs are harder to
peel, so try boiling eggs that you have had for a few days.

1. Eat and enjoy!
