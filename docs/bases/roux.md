# Roux

A roux is a base for several things.

## Ingredients

* 2 tbl spoons butter
* 4 tbl spoons plain flour
* 2 cups milk

## Method

1. In a small, heavy saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over the lowest
heat possible.

1. Blend the flour into the melted butter and stir periodically for 4-5 minutes.
Do not walk away from the stove as you need to ensure the flour does not brown

1. When the flour begins to pick up a very light brown colour, slowly add 1 cup
of milk and ensure it's fully mixed. As the roux thickens add more milk.

1. Continue cooking slowly until smooth and thickened. Noting that it will
thicken further as it cools.

and a tea spoon of salt.
